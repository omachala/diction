## Why Diction?

- **Voice and AI, built into the keyboard.** Tap to dictate. Tap again, AI writes the message for you. Tap again, AI edits the whole field. Custom modes let you add your own AI prompts, URL schemes, and Shortcuts.
- **Full keyboard, not just a mic button.** QWERTY when you need it, voice when you want it. The keyboard you never need to switch away from.
- **Self-hosted in one command.** `docker compose up` and paste the URL. Your server, your models, your data.
- **Works with any Whisper server.** Diction speaks the OpenAI transcription API directly. Point it at any endpoint that implements it, with or without our gateway.
- **On-device.** Whisper and Parakeet run locally on your iPhone. No network, no server, nothing leaves the device.
- **Encrypted in transit.** AES-256-GCM with X25519 key exchange between the app and the gateway. Same primitives used by Signal and WireGuard.
- **Zero tracking.** No analytics, no telemetry, no data collection. Audit the source yourself.
- **Free and unlimited.** On-device and self-hosted have no caps, no restrictions, no expiry.

## Self-Hosting

The Diction app streams audio over a WebSocket connection, so you need the Diction Gateway in front of whatever speech model you run. The gateway handles the WebSocket protocol, end-to-end encryption, optional LLM cleanup, and model routing.

> **Full walkthrough with screenshots:** [How to Set Up Diction - the self-hosted speech-to-text alternative to Wispr Flow](https://dev.to/omachala/how-to-set-up-diction-the-self-hosted-speech-to-text-alternative-to-wispr-flow-20km)

**Requirements:**
- Any machine that can run Docker: Mac, Linux box, NUC, home server, VPS. Apple Silicon works (via Rosetta).
- iPhone running iOS 17.0 or later.

### Step 1 - Write the Compose File

Create a folder for the stack and save this as `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
services:
  whisper-small:
    image: fedirz/faster-whisper-server:latest-cpu
    container_name: diction-whisper-small
    restart: unless-stopped
    volumes:
      - whisper-models:/root/.cache/huggingface
    environment:
      WHISPER__MODEL: Systran/faster-whisper-small
      WHISPER__INFERENCE_DEVICE: cpu

  gateway:
    image: ghcr.io/omachala/diction-gateway:latest
    platform: linux/amd64
    container_name: diction-gateway
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    depends_on:
      - whisper-small
    environment:
      DEFAULT_MODEL: small

volumes:
  whisper-models:
```

The `whisper-models` volume persists the model weights (~500 MB for `small`) so they survive container rebuilds. `DEFAULT_MODEL: small` maps to the service named `whisper-small` - see [Swap the Speech Model](#swap-the-speech-model) if you change the model.

### Step 2 - Start the Stack

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

First run pulls the images and downloads model weights - give it 2–3 minutes.

```bash
docker compose logs -f          # watch progress
docker compose ps               # check status
```

Expected:

```
NAME                     STATUS
diction-gateway          Up 30 seconds
diction-whisper-small    Up 2 minutes (healthy)
```

| Error | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| `pull access denied` on gateway image | `docker logout ghcr.io` and retry |
| `exec format error` on Apple Silicon | Enable Rosetta in Docker Desktop → Settings → General |
| `health: starting` for > 3 minutes | Model still downloading - `docker compose logs -f whisper-small` |
| Gateway exits immediately | Whisper container failed - check its logs |

### Step 3 - Test the Server

Generate a test audio file (macOS):

```bash
say -o test.aiff "Hello from my home server"
```

Or record a voice memo on your phone and AirDrop it over.

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/v1/audio/transcriptions \
  -F "file=@test.aiff" \
  -F "model=small"
```

```json
{"text":"Hello from my home server."}
```

```bash
# Check timing headers
curl -sS -D - -o /dev/null \
  -X POST http://localhost:8080/v1/audio/transcriptions \
  -F "file=@test.aiff" -F "model=small" | grep -i diction
```

`X-Diction-Whisper-Ms` shows the speech model's inference latency.

| Response | Cause |
|----------|-------|
| Connection refused | Gateway not running - `docker compose ps` |
| 504 Gateway Timeout | Whisper still loading - wait 60s |
| 404 Not Found | URL typo - path must be exactly `/v1/audio/transcriptions` |
| OOM / container crash | Model too large for available RAM |

### Step 4 - Find Your Server's IP

**macOS:**
```bash
ipconfig getifaddr en0
# or
ifconfig | grep 'inet ' | grep -v 127.0.0.1
```

**Linux:**
```bash
hostname -I | awk '{print $1}'
```

**Windows:**
```powershell
ipconfig | findstr IPv4
```

Pick the `192.168.x.x` or `10.x.x.x` address. Ignore anything starting with `100.` - that's Tailscale.

Set a DHCP reservation in your router so the IP doesn't change on reboot. Or use [Tailscale](#reach-from-anywhere) for a stable address that follows the machine anywhere.

### Step 5 - Connect the App

Install [Diction](https://apps.apple.com/app/id6759807364) on your iPhone. On first launch:

1. Settings → General → Keyboard → Keyboards → Add New Keyboard → **Diction**
2. Tap Diction in the list → enable **Allow Full Access**
3. Grant microphone access when prompted

Point it at your server:

1. Open Diction → **Preferences** → **Mode** → **Self-Hosted**
2. Enter your endpoint: `http://192.168.1.42:8080` (your IP from Step 4)
3. Tap **Test connection** - you should get a green check within a second

To dictate: open any app, tap a text field, long-press the globe icon (bottom-left of the iOS keyboard), pick **Diction**, tap the mic, speak, release.

### Reach From Anywhere

**Tailscale (recommended)**

[Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/) creates a private WireGuard mesh between your devices. Install it on the server and iPhone, sign in to the same account, and use the `100.x.x.x` Tailscale IP as your Diction endpoint. Works on cellular, café WiFi, anywhere. Free for personal use.

**Cloudflare Tunnel (public URL, no port forwarding)**

Add to your compose file:

```yaml
  cloudflared:
    image: cloudflare/cloudflared:latest
    container_name: diction-cloudflared
    restart: unless-stopped
    command: tunnel --no-autoupdate run
    environment:
      TUNNEL_TOKEN: "${CLOUDFLARE_TUNNEL_TOKEN}"
```

Create a tunnel in the [Cloudflare Zero Trust dashboard](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com/), grab the token, add it to `.env`, route the public hostname to `http://gateway:8080`. Free tier. Note: transcripts pass through Cloudflare's network (HTTPS-encrypted, but a third party is in the path).

**ngrok (quick testing)**

```bash
ngrok http 8080
```

Free tier URLs change on restart - good for a demo, not daily use.

---

## Swap the Speech Model

Change two lines in your compose file:

| `DEFAULT_MODEL` | Service name | `WHISPER__MODEL` | RAM | Notes |
|-----------------|--------------|------------------|-----|-------|
| `small` | `whisper-small` | `Systran/faster-whisper-small` | ~850 MB | Best for CPU |
| `medium` | `whisper-medium` | `Systran/faster-whisper-medium` | ~2.1 GB | More accurate, slower on CPU |
| `large-v3-turbo` | `whisper-large-turbo` | `deepdml/faster-whisper-large-v3-turbo-ct2` | ~2.3 GB | Best with NVIDIA GPU |
| `parakeet-v3` | `parakeet` | - (baked into image) | ~2 GB | NVIDIA GPU, 25 European languages |

Both `DEFAULT_MODEL` and the service name must match the table - the gateway resolves backends by Docker hostname. A mismatch returns 404 on every request.

```bash
docker compose up -d   # recreates only the changed container
```

---

## NVIDIA GPU

Install the [NVIDIA Container Toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/install-guide.html) on the host first.

### Option A - Parakeet TDT 0.6B v3 (fastest, 25 European languages)

[Parakeet](https://huggingface.co/nvidia/parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v3) transcribes a 5-second clip in well under a second on a consumer GPU.

| | Whisper Large-v3 | Parakeet TDT 0.6B v3 |
|---|---|---|
| WER (English) | 7.4% | ~6.3% |
| Latency (GPU) | Under 2s | Sub-second |
| VRAM (INT8) | ~2.3 GB | ~2 GB |
| Languages | 99 | 25 European |

**Supported languages:** English, Bulgarian, Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, Estonian, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Hungarian, Italian, Latvian, Lithuanian, Maltese, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Slovak, Slovenian, Spanish, Swedish, Russian, Ukrainian.

For languages outside this list, use Option B.

```yaml
services:
  parakeet:
    image: ghcr.io/achetronic/parakeet:latest-int8
    container_name: diction-parakeet
    restart: unless-stopped
    deploy:
      resources:
        reservations:
          devices:
            - driver: nvidia
              count: 1
              capabilities: [gpu]

  gateway:
    image: ghcr.io/omachala/diction-gateway:latest
    platform: linux/amd64
    container_name: diction-gateway
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    depends_on:
      - parakeet
    environment:
      DEFAULT_MODEL: parakeet-v3
```

Model weights are baked into the image - no download on first start. Or use the profile from this repo:

```bash
docker compose --profile parakeet up -d
```

### Option B - large-v3-turbo (multilingual, 99 languages)

```yaml
services:
  whisper-large-turbo:
    image: fedirz/faster-whisper-server:latest-cuda
    container_name: diction-whisper-large-turbo
    restart: unless-stopped
    volumes:
      - whisper-models:/root/.cache/huggingface
    environment:
      WHISPER__MODEL: deepdml/faster-whisper-large-v3-turbo-ct2
      WHISPER__INFERENCE_DEVICE: cuda
      WHISPER__COMPUTE_TYPE: float16
    deploy:
      resources:
        reservations:
          devices:
            - driver: nvidia
              count: 1
              capabilities: [gpu]

  gateway:
    image: ghcr.io/omachala/diction-gateway:latest
    platform: linux/amd64
    container_name: diction-gateway
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    depends_on:
      - whisper-large-turbo
    environment:
      DEFAULT_MODEL: large-v3-turbo

volumes:
  whisper-models:
```

First boot downloads ~1.6 GB of model weights into the volume. Subsequent starts are instant.

## Already Have a Voice Server?

Keep it. Use `CUSTOM_BACKEND_URL` to put the Diction Gateway in front of your existing server for WebSocket streaming and end-to-end encryption:

```yaml
services:
  gateway:
    image: ghcr.io/omachala/diction-gateway:latest
    platform: linux/amd64
    container_name: diction-gateway
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    environment:
      CUSTOM_BACKEND_URL: http://your-existing-server:8000
      CUSTOM_BACKEND_MODEL: Systran/faster-whisper-small
```

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `CUSTOM_BACKEND_AUTH` | Authorization header forwarded to your backend, e.g. `Bearer sk-xxx` |
| `CUSTOM_BACKEND_NEEDS_WAV` | Set to `"true"` if your backend only accepts WAV - the gateway converts with ffmpeg |
| `CUSTOM_BACKEND_CANONICAL_ID` | HuggingFace-style ID advertised via `/v1/models` (default: `CUSTOM_BACKEND_MODEL`) |

---

## AI Cleanup (BYO LLM)

The gateway passes transcripts through any OpenAI-compatible LLM before returning them. You say "so um basically the meeting went well and uh they agreed to the timeline." The LLM returns "The meeting went well. They agreed to the timeline."

Enable the **AI Companion** toggle in the app. The gateway forwards the transcript to `{LLM_BASE_URL}/chat/completions` with your prompt, then returns the cleaned text. If the LLM fails, the raw transcript is returned - dictation never breaks.

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `LLM_BASE_URL` | Yes | OpenAI-compatible endpoint, e.g. `https://api.openai.com/v1` |
| `LLM_MODEL` | Yes | Model identifier, e.g. `gpt-4o-mini` |
| `LLM_API_KEY` | No | Bearer token. Not needed for local Ollama. |
| `LLM_PROMPT` | No | System prompt string, or a file path starting with `/` (mount via volume) |
| `LLM_REASONING_EFFORT` | No | OpenAI-compatible reasoning effort such as `none`, `low`, `medium`, or `high`. Omitted by default. |

Both `LLM_BASE_URL` and `LLM_MODEL` must be set or the feature stays off.

### Option A - Cloud LLM (OpenAI, Groq, etc.)

```bash
echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-key-here" > .env
```

```yaml
  gateway:
    environment:
      DEFAULT_MODEL: small
      LLM_BASE_URL: "https://api.openai.com/v1"
      LLM_API_KEY: "${OPENAI_API_KEY}"
      LLM_MODEL: "gpt-4o-mini"
      LLM_PROMPT: "Clean up this voice transcription. Remove filler words (um, uh, like). Fix punctuation and capitalization. Return only the cleaned text, nothing else."
```

Docker Compose reads `${OPENAI_API_KEY}` from `.env` automatically. Works with any OpenAI-compatible provider - Groq, Together, Fireworks, Mistral, OpenRouter - swap `LLM_BASE_URL` and `LLM_MODEL`.

### Option B - Local Ollama (zero cost, fully private)

```yaml
  ollama:
    image: ollama/ollama:latest
    container_name: diction-ollama
    restart: unless-stopped
    volumes:
      - ollama-models:/root/.ollama

  gateway:
    environment:
      DEFAULT_MODEL: small
      LLM_BASE_URL: "http://ollama:11434/v1"
      LLM_MODEL: "gemma2:9b"
      LLM_PROMPT: "Clean up this voice transcription. Remove filler words. Fix punctuation and capitalization. Return only the cleaned text, nothing else."

volumes:
  whisper-models:
  ollama-models:
```

```bash
docker compose up -d
docker exec diction-ollama ollama pull gemma2:9b
```

| Model | Memory | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| `gemma2:9b` | ~6 GB | Best cleanup quality at this size |
| `qwen2.5:7b` | ~5 GB | Strong instruction following |
| `llama3.1:8b` | ~5 GB | Most popular, well-tested |
| `gemma3:4b` | ~3 GB | For tighter machines |

Models under 7B tend to answer questions about the transcript instead of cleaning it up. 7B or larger recommended.

### Testing cleanup

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8080/v1/audio/transcriptions?enhance=true" \
  -F "file=@test.aiff" \
  -F "model=small"
```

```bash
# Confirm LLM fired - look for X-Diction-LLM-Ms in the output
curl -sS -D - -o /dev/null \
  -X POST "http://localhost:8080/v1/audio/transcriptions?enhance=true" \
  -F "file=@test.aiff" -F "model=small" | grep -i diction
```

### Prompt file

Mount a file and point `LLM_PROMPT` at the path:

```yaml
  gateway:
    volumes:
      - ./cleanup-prompt.txt:/config/prompt.txt:ro
    environment:
      LLM_PROMPT: "/config/prompt.txt"
```

If `LLM_PROMPT` starts with `/`, the gateway reads it as a file. Otherwise it uses the string directly.

---

## NixOS

The repo ships a flake with a hardened systemd module - no Docker needed.

```bash
nix run github:omachala/diction#diction-gateway
```

Enable as a service:

```nix
{
  inputs.diction.url = "github:omachala/diction";

  outputs = { nixpkgs, diction, ... }: {
    nixosConfigurations.your-host = nixpkgs.lib.nixosSystem {
      modules = [
        diction.nixosModules.default
        {
          services.diction-gateway = {
            enable = true;
            openFirewall = true;
            # customBackend.url = "http://127.0.0.1:8000";
            # llm.baseUrl = "http://127.0.0.1:11434/v1";
            # llm.model = "gemma2:9b";
            # environmentFile = "/run/secrets/diction-gateway.env";
          };
        }
      ];
    };
  };
}
```

The unit runs under `DynamicUser` with `ProtectSystem=strict`, `NoNewPrivileges`, and a narrow syscall filter. Use `environmentFile` for secrets - they don't end up in the world-readable Nix store. Full option list: [`nix/module.nix`](nix/module.nix).

---

## OpenAI API Compatibility

The gateway implements the OpenAI audio transcription API - any client that works against `api.openai.com/v1/audio/transcriptions` works against a Diction gateway.

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(
    base_url="http://your-server:8080/v1",
    api_key="anything",  # not checked when AUTH_ENABLED=false
)

with open("audio.wav", "rb") as f:
    result = client.audio.transcriptions.create(
        file=f,
        model="small",            # or "Systran/faster-whisper-small"
        response_format="text",
    )
print(result)
```

Works with the Node SDK, LangChain, Flowise, n8n, or any tool that expects OpenAI's speech API.

**Supported:**

- `POST /v1/audio/transcriptions` - `file`, `model`, `language`, `prompt`, `response_format=json|text`
- `GET /v1/models` - returns an OpenAI-compatible `data[]` array plus a `providers[]` grouping consumed by the iOS app. Both HuggingFace IDs (`Systran/faster-whisper-small`, `nvidia/parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v3`) and short aliases (`small`, `medium`, `large-v3-turbo`, `parakeet-v3`) are accepted.
- WebSocket `/v1/audio/stream` - used by the Diction app for low-latency streaming

**Not supported:**

- TTS (`/v1/audio/speech`)
- `response_format=verbose_json|srt|vtt` (no word-level timestamps)
- SSE streaming on REST (use WebSocket `/v1/audio/stream` instead)
- Model download/delete (`POST`/`DELETE /v1/models/{id}`)
- OpenAI Realtime API (`/v1/realtime`)

**Authentication** is off by default (`AUTH_ENABLED=false`). Pass any non-empty string as the API key from the client - the gateway doesn't check it. To lock down a public-facing deployment, set `AUTH_ENABLED=true` and configure tokens in the gateway env.

**Error shape:** errors return `{"error":"<message>"}`, not OpenAI's nested `{"error":{"message":"...","type":"..."}}`. Most SDKs surface these as `HTTPError` rather than `APIError`.

---

## Privacy

- **On-device**: Everything stays on your phone. No network connection is made.
- **Self-hosted**: Audio goes to your server only. Neither the gateway nor `faster-whisper-server` persists audio - it's transcribed and discarded.
- **AI cleanup enabled**: The transcript (plain text, no audio) goes to your configured LLM. If you use Ollama locally, nothing leaves your machine.
- **Diction One (cloud)**: Audio is transcribed and immediately discarded. Not stored, not used for training.
- **Zero third-party SDKs** in the app. No analytics, no tracking, no telemetry.
- **Full Access** is required by iOS for any keyboard that makes network requests. Diction has no QWERTY input - the only data that leaves the app is the audio recording, sent to the endpoint you configured.

Read the full [Privacy Policy](https://diction.one/privacy).

---

## Diction One

On-device and self-hosted are completely free with no word limits.

If you don't want to run a server, Diction One gives you a fine-tuned cloud model with advanced audio filtering - without the setup. Audio is sent to the Diction endpoint, transcribed, and immediately discarded. Pricing and trial details are in the app.
